================

Test: modification of Meteor's leaderboard

It is now possible to:
- add players and a field of study
- change the field of study of a player (choice among the existing fields)
- sort the players by name, score or field
- remove a player (removing all players in any forked leaderboard will delete it)
- make a copy of a board to another route (duplicates the information in the database)
- go to the "about" page, and come back to the main page
